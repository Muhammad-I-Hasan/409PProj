# ENSF 409 W22 Final Project

## Problem Statement
Develop an Application that distributs hampers of food from a local foodbank to Users/Clients that are in need of it

## Our application
we used implemented this project using java and the tools we were tauight in this course. In order to use our application the user should pull the repository and run GUI.java. user will be prompted to create the household the client resides in. meaning the user will need to fill in how many people and of what type are in the household. the user can create multiple households. after the creation of these households the user can press teh create hampers button that generates hampers for each of the household based on there needs each of the hampers will minimize the calories needed to suffice the households needs will also making sure that all the other fields (grain, fruits veggies etc..) are meet in par with the households needs. if each hamper for each household suffices these needs then the food is taken out of the database and given to the households otherwise tells the user that it cannot create the hampers whcih means the user needs to reorganize the households.
